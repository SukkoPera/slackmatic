This package includes httpup, a utility for one-way
synchronization with remote file repositories over http.


NOTES

1.  Executables are installed in /usr/bin.

2.  The httpup-make(8) utility is used to generate a repository definition
file for a slackmatic repository.  It replaces the httpup-repgen utility
from the source distribution.

3.  The repository definition file for a slackmatic repository
is named `HTTPUP'.


GOTCHAS

1.  httpup does not preserve file access permissions.  If you
are developing a repository, make sure that any BUILD.rc
scripts set executable bits in the package when necessary,
rather than rely on file permissions within the port.

2.  The correct syntax for the httpup command is:

    httpup <COMMAND> [OPTIONS] <ARGS>

That is, the <COMMAND> (one of sync|copy|list) should preceed
the options.

For example, this works:

    httpup sync -r HTTPUP http://someurl/ /some/path

While this form fails:

    httpup -r HTTPUP sync http://someurl/ /some/path
